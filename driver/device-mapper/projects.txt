    List of projects, ideas and pending bug fixes
   ===============================================

 o Use devfs auto device allocation to get devices rather than a fixed
   series of devices (which limits us to 256 volumes atm)

   - Ought to have an option of using the old version for non-devfs systems
   - Would be nice if the auto device allocation was independant of devfs

 o Need to work out how to make module use counts work correctly. The existing
   scheme does not allow us to unload the module. A reference is taken during
   kern_mount() which does not allow us to rmmod() so even if the right
   umount() functions were exported (which they aren't) we'd never get to
   call them anyway. This could be tricky.

 o Check tables are an integer multiple of the underlying block size at
   table load time.

 o Use Al Viro's new code for "proc files consisting of one line per entry"
   for the error and status files. [This item waiting for the patches to
   reach the kernel and for their suitability to be further investigated
   and checked]

 o Error code (as well as error list) so that "out of memory" errors can
   result in messages which can be read from the error file.

 o Further reduction of common code between the filesystem source files.
