    List of projects, ideas and pending bug fixes
   ===============================================

 o Need to work out how to make module use counts work correctly. The existing
   scheme does not allow us to unload the module. A reference is taken during
   kern_mount() which does not allow us to rmmod() so even if the right
   umount() functions were exported (which they aren't) we'd never get to
   call them anyway. This could be tricky.

 o Check tables are an integer multiple of the underlying block size at
   table load time.

 o Error code (as well as error list) so that "out of memory" errors can
   result in messages which can be read from the error file.
