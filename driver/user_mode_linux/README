setup-uml - script to build a user mode linux system, with the lvm driver
            symbolically linked back to the LVM dir so I can work from CVS.

uml-lvm.patch - patch to enable lvm in the uml configuration

uml.patch.bz2 - uml patch from 
                http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=429

config-uml - .config which turns on LVM


RUNNING 
-------

o checkout an LVM dir for use with uml
  make sure you've got a copy of a root filesystem kicking about

o edit the variables at the top of 'setup'

o run setup-uml

o move to your uml dir and run lvm-install as root

o then run the 'up' script to run uml

o if you want to rebuild uml after changing the LVM driver just change into
  the linux directory and do a 'make linux ARCH=um'.  Don't forget the ARCH=um.
