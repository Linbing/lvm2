LVM2 installation
=================

1) Install device-mapper

   Ensure the device-mapper has been installed on the machine.

   The device-mapper should be in the kernel (look for 'device-mapper'
   messages in the kernel logs) and /usr/include/libdevmapper.h should 
   be present.

   The device-mapper is available from:
     ftp://ftp.sistina.com/pub/LVM2/device-mapper/


2) Generate custom makefiles.

   Run the 'configure' script from the top directory.

   If you do not have GNU readline (http://www.gnu.org/directory/readline.html)
   installed use
     ./configure --disable-readline


3) Build and install LVM2.

   Run 'make install' from the top directory.


4) Create a configuration file
